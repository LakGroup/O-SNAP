# O-SNAP

**O-SNAP** is a data analysis pipeline to automate the generation of morphological features derived from SMLM images of nuclear targets. It is conceptually related to **ECLiPSE**, another analysis pipeline developed from our group. It features:
- Automated generation of 144 morphological features
- Volcano analyis to measure fold-change in pair-wise manner between O-SNAP featurs
- Feature set enrichment analysis for changes in general trends between phenotype pairs
- Create suite of classifiers to compare phenotypes based on O-SNAP features
- Other forms of analysis to compare nuclei of different groups
