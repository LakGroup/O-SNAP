# NuCLiPSE

**NuCLiPSE** is a data analysis pipeline to automate the generation of morphological features derived from SMLM images of nuclear targets. It is conceptually related to **ECLiPSE**, another analysis pipeline developed from our group. It features:
- Automated generation of 90+ morphological features
- Code to prepare for classification using Matlab's live Classification Learner App
- Other forms of analysis to compare nuclei of different groups
